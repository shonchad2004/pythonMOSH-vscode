#      A.     ATTRIBUTES
'''
Attributes can either belong to the class itself or to individual instances (objects).

1.  Instance Attributes
        Belong to individual objects.
        Unique to each object.
        Defined inside the __init__ method or directly through the object.

2.   Class Attributes
        Shared by all objects of the class.
        Defined outside the __init__ method.
        Useful for properties that are the same for every object.
'''

#     B.   CONSTRUCTOR   =    __init__(self, attritube1, attr2)
'''
1.  Without a constructor, youâ€™d need to manually set attributes after creating an object, 
    which can be tedious. A constructor makes sure that every object is properly initialized as soon as it's created.

2.  Constructor is a special method used to initialize the 
    attributes of an object when it is created.
